# HR_Analytics-Dashboard

üìä __Project Objective:__

The primary goal of this project is to uncover the key factors influencing employee attrition and deliver actionable insights to support strategic workforce retention. The interactive dashboard created offers comprehensive visibility into attrition trends within the organization, assisting the HR team in their analysis and decision-making processes.

üîç __Project Scope:__  

Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to:
    - Analyze detailed HR data to extract meaningful patterns and trends.
    - Design and develop interactive dashboards to visualize critical HR metrics.
    - Deliver data-driven insights and strategic recommendations for improving employee retention.

üõ†Ô∏è __Steps Followed:__

    - Data Acquisition:
          * Downloaded the HR dataset in .csv format and imported it into Power BI.
          * Loaded the data into Power Query Editor for preprocessing.

    - Data Cleaning:
        * Removed unnecessary columns, duplicates, and errors.
        * Replaced inconsistent values and renamed columns for clarity.
        * Applied data type detection to ensure accurate data representation.

    - Data Processing:
        * Created a new column "AttritionCount" using conditional logic: (If Attrition = "Yes", then 1; else 0).
        * Developed KPIs and charts using this new column.
        * Computed Attrition Rate using DAX: 
            Attrition Rate = SUM([AttritionCount]) / SUM([EmployeeCount])

    - Data Analysis & Visualization:
        * Built multiple visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, matrix tables, and slicers.
        * Utilized these visual tools to present findings in an intuitive and actionable format.
